# nk

`nk` is a tiny x86-64 operating system written in Rust. It boots through the
Limine bootloader on BIOS and UEFI systems, brings up a small microkernel-style
core, starts Ring 3 tasks, and now launches a minimal GUI as a separate ELF
binary.

## Current Status

- Boots in QEMU through Limine/BIOS.
- Initializes GDT/TSS, IDT, PIC, and the PIT timer.
- Builds a dedicated userland page-table root.
- Starts Ring 3 tasks through `iretq` and saved trapframes.
- Uses timer interrupt trapframes as scheduler context.
- Loads `/boot/gui.elf` as a Limine boot module.
- Parses the GUI ELF in the kernel and starts it as a user process.
- Provides minimal GUI syscalls for clearing the screen, drawing rectangles,
  and drawing tiny bitmap text.
- Shows a movable "Hallo Welt!" window drawn by the userland GUI process.

## Architecture

- `src/main.rs`: kernel entry and bootstrap sequence.
- `src/gdt.rs`: GDT, kernel/user segments, TSS, and kernel stacks.
- `src/interrupts.rs`: IDT, exception diagnostics, PIC/PIT setup, timer IRQs,
  trapframe scheduling, and the `int 0x80` syscall boundary.
- `src/memory.rs`: user page-table creation, user image pages, user stacks, and
  kernel-only framebuffer mapping for syscall handlers.
- `src/scheduler.rs`: minimal kernel scheduler plus trapframe-based user task
  scheduling.
- `src/userland.rs`: address-space model, ELF loader, task frame setup, CR3
  switch, and Ring 3 entry.
- `src/services.rs`: kernel-side framebuffer service used by GUI syscalls.
- `src/framebuffer.rs`: low-level pixel and rectangle drawing.
- `src/limine.rs`: Limine framebuffer, HHDM, kernel address, and module
  requests.
- `src/pci.rs` and `src/virtio.rs`: PCI scan, Virtio capability discovery, and
  early queue memory setup.
- `user/gui/src/main.rs`: separate no_std Rust GUI executable.
- `user/gui/linker.ld`: GUI ELF linker script.

## Install Tools

Windows with an administrator PowerShell:

```powershell
.\scripts\install-tools-admin.ps1
```

Linux/WSL/Ubuntu:

```bash
./scripts/install-tools-ubuntu.sh
```

The Windows installer uses Chocolatey, which requires access to
`C:\ProgramData`.

## Build

Windows:

```powershell
.\scripts\build-limine.ps1
```

Linux/WSL:

```bash
./scripts/build-limine.sh
```

The build script creates both:

- `target/x86_64-unknown-none/release/nk`: the kernel.
- `build/user/gui.elf`: the separate userland GUI executable.

Both files are copied into the ISO under `/boot`.

## Run in QEMU

Windows:

```powershell
.\scripts\build-limine.ps1 -Run
```

UEFI test with edk2/OVMF from the QEMU installation:

```powershell
.\scripts\build-limine.ps1 -Run -Uefi
```

Linux/WSL:

```bash
./scripts/build-limine.sh run
```

## Virtio Smoke Test

With a Virtio block device and Virtio keyboard, the serial log prints detected
Virtio PCI devices:

```powershell
$disk = "$PWD\build\virtio-test.img"
[IO.File]::WriteAllBytes($disk, (New-Object byte[] 1048576))
& "C:\Program Files\qemu\qemu-system-x86_64.exe" `
  -M q35 -m 256M -cdrom .\build\nk.iso `
  -drive "file=$disk,format=raw,if=none,id=vd0" `
  -device virtio-blk-pci,drive=vd0 `
  -device virtio-keyboard-pci `
  -serial stdio
```

## Next Useful Steps

- Add real input delivery so the userland GUI window can be dragged by mouse or
  keyboard instead of moving autonomously.
- Replace the fixed user image buffer with per-process page allocation.
- Split GUI syscalls into a proper capability-checked IPC protocol.
- Register Virtio queues with devices and issue the first block/input requests.
- Move more kernel-side services behind explicit userland/server boundaries.
